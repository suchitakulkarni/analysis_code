This is a simple code that loops over all files in given directory. For a given file.
It loops over all events of that file and gets entry. No histogram is filled. There is a minimal output. 

To run, type make and for runLooper give instructions
./runLooper ./test_sample BSM_susy ./ 1 1000

The final arguement of runLooper has no meaning to it. The cross section is set to 1. 

The code breaks once the loop over events is complete. It however does not break for events less than roughly 2000.
